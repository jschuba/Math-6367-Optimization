However, the example presented in class (from page 188 of the book) has an interesting feature that the matrices $T$ and $h$ change depending on whether the current solution is less than or greater than the random variable being considered.  This made us realize that blindly putting matricies into the solver was not adequate.  We need a way to programmically change these matrices for each portion of step 2 and 3 of the algorithm.  \n",
